# TOA-Project-
This project involves the development of a Turing Machine simulator with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Python's Tkinter library. The simulator allows users to perform various operations on a tape of characters, such as reversing the tape, counting occurrences of a character, changing the case of characters, searching for a substring, and removing duplicates.
